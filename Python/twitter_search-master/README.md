# `twitter_search.py`

[My blog post](https://galeascience.wordpress.com/2016/03/18/collecting-twitter-data-with-python/) gives a thorough explanation of how to set up the code (including the dependancies), what it's doing, and an example how to use the resulting tweet data.  I've also included the basics below.

This program will search for tweets and save them to a .JSON formatted file. Twitter limits the amount of tweets that can be downloaded per 15 minutes; as such, when an exception is raised (i.e., the maximum allowed number of tweets has been reached) the script will pause for 15 minutes and then continue.


### Dependencies

To access the Twitter API I used Tweepy 3.5.0.  I also imported the libaraies: json, datetime, time, os and sys.

In addition, you'll need a personal [Twitter "data-mining" application](https://apps.twitter.com/) (which is very easy to set up). I used [this guide] (http://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/02/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-1/#Register_Your_App) to register my app. You will need to register your own in order to generate a consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret; these are required to authenticate the script in order to access the Twitter API.


### Running the script

1) Save the python file or download/clone the repository to your local machine.  Make sure you have the dependencies.

2) Open the `twitter_search.py` file and then find the `load_api()` function (at the top) and add your consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret.  For example:
```
consumer_key = '189YcjF4IUzF156RGNGNucDD8'
consumer_secret = 'd7HY36s4pSh03HxjDg782HupUjmzdOOSDd98hd'
access_token = '2543812-cpaIuwndjvbdjaDDp5izzndhsD7figa9gb'
access_secret = '4hdyfnas7d988ddjf87sJdj3Dxn4d5CcNpwe'
```

3) Go to the `main()` function and edit the search criteria. Namely, you should enter a search phrase, the maximum time limit for the script to run, and the date range for the search (relative to today). For example:
```
search_phrase = '#makedonalddrumpfagain'
time_limit = 1.0 # runtime limit in hours
min_days_old, max_days_old = 1, 2 # search limits

# e.g. min_days_old, max_days_old = 7, 8
# gives the current weekday from last week,
# min_days_old=0 will search from right now
```

4) Open the terminal/command line to the file location and type: 
```
python twitter_search.py
```
The script will run until all tweets within your search criteria have been found.
